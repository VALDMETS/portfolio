    description: <section><p>QuarterNote is the mobile musical messenger browser app of the future - and today! Built with React and Backbone, it allows users to type out a message, preview it, and then send it off as a song animation rendered client side. It features a mutual friending system, point keeping on messages sent, and more!</p><p>Back end data is stored as JSON on a MongoDB configured server and messages are parsed via a syllable algorithm I created. Sounds and user avatars were created by me as well - fonts and animation backgrounds are open-use assets. This is my final project at the Iron Yard coding academy, completed in September 2016.</p></section>
